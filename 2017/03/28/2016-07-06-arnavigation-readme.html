<h3 id="about-the-project">About The Project</h3>
<p>We tried out experimenting Augmented Reality as a summer project. Our aim was to design a navigation app which instead of showing top view of map shows directions on real time camera feed. This will have two fold benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The users will not have to match roads and adjust map to understand where to go</li>
  <li>Since it shows real time camera feed the user can remain in real world while looking for directions preventing accidents</li>
  <li>Received the <strong>Best Programming Club Project</strong> during the Science &amp; Technology Summer Camp 2016.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="approach-to-inculcate-ar-in-android-app">Approach to inculcate AR in android app</h3>
<p>Unlike infrared sensors we didnâ€™t have any means to calculate the exact distance of the real time objects in the mobiles so we switched to MATHEMATICS for our answers. OH! Technical Arts also played a key role in devising our strategy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We used GPS data combiined with mobiles orientation from Magnetic Compass to detect roads. Here Google Directions API came in handy to give the precise coordinates of the roads.</li>
  <li>We measured the relative motion of the user via gyroscope, accelerometer and GPS coordinates</li>
  <li>The Unity graphics were relayed on the camera feed via UNITY GAME ENGINE giving the graphics (navigating arrows) a psuedo-acceleration to look static on the ground.</li>
</ul>
