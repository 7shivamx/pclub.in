# Web Development Lecture Series: Introduction

## Basics of what the browser does
Here we briefly describe the back-breaking work the browser does, every time you open your favorite websites.

The internet does not understand `facebook.com`. Yet, everything on the internet has an address. How does this work?

There is a protocol called `IP`, which provides a numeric address to every computer on the internet. So when you open `pclub.in`, your computer somehow figures out where the files for the website are stored. Here, we mean that your computer has to find out how to locate the machine storing the files for `pclub.in`. Here is what happens:

* Your browser talks to a machine called **DNS Server**, which converts `pclub.in` to an IP address. In this case, it is `192.30.252.153`.
* This IP address is where the files are to be found. So now your computer tells the internet to provide the files placed at that location.
* The first file to be loaded is an `HTML` web page. This is something which describes the structure of the page, what it contains, and what all other images etc need to be fetched.
* The browser reads the `HTML` file, and figures out the extra files it will need to fetch for that.
* It fetches some `CSS` files (for styling), some `JS` files (for interactive behavior), and images.
* The above files need not all be on `pclub.in`. I could link to some image lying at some other website's location, and the browser would repeat the same procedure as above for that file, finding that website's location and then getting the image.

## Exploring the files being received
Here's a simple exercise. Open a new tab in your browser, and press F12. You will see a (scary looking?) panel pop up, to your right or at the bottom. Don't lose heart, it isn't all that scary :) It is called *Developer Tools*, or related terms, depending on the context.

Now you need to click on the tab named `Network` in that panel. Once you've done that, open up `pclub.in`.

It would probably look somewhat like in the images below.

For **Chrome**:
![](/assets/image/article/chrome-network.png)

For **Firefox**:
![](/assets/image/article/firefox-network.png)

I'll be referring to the **Google Chrome** image.

* Note the first entry in the list. It says `pclub.in`. That means that you made a request for `pclub.in`. You can even see when it finished in the bars on the right.
* Some `css` files follow that request. They are necessary for making the page look good, and provide all the styling information.
* A little down, there is an entry called `pclub.png`. That was a request made for the main PClub image, and as you can see, it made it to your screen.

There are plenty more files, which we don't need to know about so soon. We urge you to give this a shot, try this yourself, and explore (Google) more on this.

## Topics to be covered
Here's a brief description of what this series will attempt to cover, and what those topics are.

### HTML
Say you need to design a poster, how would you go about doing that?

You begin with a vague idea. Perhaps you want a title, followed by a subtitle. A title image would be good too. Some text in paragraphs, and some more images.

Note that the things which immediately come to mind describe the structure of the poster. You could later on choose to write things in a pretty font, display images to the right; or even choose to make the font size in the paragraphs larger than the title itself. This all is secondary. What you initially need to know is, what is the structure of the document.

On the web, that is precisely what HTML does. HTML, (or Hyper Text Markup Language) is a templating language, meaning that it let's you create a template of what structure you have in mind. Displaying it nicely is a whole other matter, which we will look at later.

Here are some of the things which are preferably done in HTML, for a web page:

* Title of the page (the one which is displayed as the name of the current tab)
* Information about the web page for browsers
* The *body* of the webpage, which you see.
* Images in the web page
* Text in the web page
* Subdividing text into paragraphs
* Adding whitespace (newlines, spaces etc)
* Some simple styling of webpages
* Quite more :)

### CSS
Now suppose you need to show something in a colored font on your webpage, or you want an image to display on the right side of the webpage instead of the left.
